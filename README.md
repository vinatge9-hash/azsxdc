# Niyantri Coffee - Project Build Notes

This repository contains a two-phase build plan:

Phase 1 (chat): Discovery and planning with the designer partner.
Phase 2 (build): Fully generated, static multi-page website using Tailwind CSS utilities for styling.

Pages included by default:
- index.html (Homepage with hero, testimonials, and quick nav)
- about.html (Our story)
- contact.html (Contact form and location note)
- menu.html (Menu items laid out in static cards)
- hours.html (Business hours)
- online-ordering.html (Placeholder for ordering)
- events.html (Upcoming events)
- location.html (Maps/Location information)
- loyalty.html (Loyalty program)
- reservations.html (Reservation form)

Key design principles:
- Warm coffee browns, creams, and gold accents
- Elegant serif headings with modern typography
- 100% Tailwind CSS styling in HTML (no external CSS files)
- Accessible HTML: semantic sections, proper titles, descriptive alt text
- Interactive elements with smooth transitions (Tailwind classes)
- Responsive navigation with a playful hamburger for mobile
